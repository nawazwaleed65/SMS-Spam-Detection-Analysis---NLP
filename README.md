# 📩 SMS Spam Detection using NLP

This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **Machine Learning** models to classify SMS messages as **spam** or **ham** (not spam).

## 🔍 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, stemming)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF** and **Bag of Words**
- Model training using:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- NLTK

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset consists of SMS messages labeled as **spam** or **ham**.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook SMS\ Spam\ Detection\ Analysis\ -\ NLP.ipynb`

## 📌 Result
